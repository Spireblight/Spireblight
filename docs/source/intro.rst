Introduction
============

Spireblight is a software designed for Slay the Spire streamers.
It features a website, a Twitch chatbot integration, a Discord interface,
and a connectivity to the Slay the Spire data.

This software was made possible thanks to the ongoing funding of Baalorlord,
and this software was custom-tailored to his needs as a result. All of the
code is made available under the MIT License, allowing any third party to
use this software as desired.

Should any other content creater want to use this software, we will be more
than happy to help tailor it.

All contributions on the Spireblight GitHub repository are welcome, and may
get integrated. The development Discord server is open to all, and the GitHub
issue tracker is recommended for feature requests.

Most of this documentation is automatically generated from the docstrings
of the modules under the `src` package.

This documentation is ongoing and currently unfinished. You can contribute to
it by accessing the GitHub repository (see the icon at the top-right of your
window) and editing the source files, under `src`, or the documentation files
directly, under `docs`.
