This contains all the information necessary to install and run this software
for people who wish to use it. It was not originally designed for use by more
than one streamer, but work is ongoing to support others.

To set it up, you must first `download Python`_.

Python 3.11 is the minimum required, with more recent versions recommended. To
set up the project, create a virtual environment and install the requirements:

    python3 -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
